# LM Training Control Panel

A comprehensive Language Model training control panel with automated feedback loops, drift detection, monitoring, and debugging capabilities.

## Features

- **Automated Training**: Feedback loops, drift detection, reinforcement, and scheduling
- **Monitoring**: Real-time training progress and automation status tracking
- **Debugging**: Advanced debugging tools for training pipelines
- **Data Versioning**: DVC integration for data and model versioning
- **LM Interfacing**: LangGraph for sophisticated language model interactions

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Initialize DVC:
   ```bash
   dvc init
   ```

3. Set up configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config/config.example.yaml config/config.yaml
   ```

4. Start the control panel:
   ```bash
   python -m src.main
   ```

## Development

- Run tests: `pytest tests/`
- Format code: `black src/ tests/`
- Lint code: `flake8 src/ tests/`
- Type check: `mypy src/`

## Documentation

See the `docs/` directory for detailed documentation on each component.
